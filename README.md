#### Objective
Using data gathered through the API of the UK police, we train a logistic regression model to predict the outcome of stop-and-searches of suspects based on various personal characteristics.

#### Discussion of ethical implications
We discuss a variation of the conundrum posed by the movie [*Minority Report* (2002)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181689/): is it ethically defensible to use prediction models in criminal investigations?

A simple prediction model leaves us unable to uncover the underlying causal mechanisms at work in the relation between personal characteristics and crime. Implementing biased models as neutral instruments in police work may compromise the rights of individual citizens.

#### Data
The majority of our data is collected through the UK police API, found [here](https://data.police.uk).
